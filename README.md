## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the angular-material-boilerplate repository and install the dependencies:

**Clone**
Clone the angular-seed repository using [git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/yuby/angular-material-boilerplate.git [your project name]
```

**Packages install**

```
npm install
```

**Packages Update**
```
npm update
```
and then

```
bower update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `bower.json` file.


### Running the App during Development

The angular-seed project comes preconfigured with a local development webserver.  It is a node.js
tool called [http-server].  You can install http-server globally:

```
sudo npm install -g http-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running:

```
cd bulid
http-server -a localhost -p 8000
```

Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `bulid/` directory.
